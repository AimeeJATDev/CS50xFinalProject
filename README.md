#### Description:
For my final project I created a website that includes a game and a highscore table. The website was built using HTML and CSS for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The game was made using Python and the highscore table was created using SQLite3. I decided on this project because I wanted to showcase as many skills as possible that I picked up during the CS50x course. 
##### Issue opened for SQLite3 problem:
