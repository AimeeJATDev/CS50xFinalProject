#### Description:
For my final project I created a website that includes a whack a mole inpired game and a highscore table. The website was built used HTML and CSS for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The game was made using Python and the highscore table was created using SQLite3. I decided on this project because I wanted to showcase as many skills as possible that I picked up during the CS50x course. 

##### The game:
I approached the game first when I started programming as it was the part of the project that was going to be the most complex. After some research I found that I could use the Pygame module to create the game, and the functions within this module were very handy when creating the grid area for the game.
