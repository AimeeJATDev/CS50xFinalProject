#### Description:
For my final project I created a website that includes a whack a mole inspired game and a highscore table. The website was built using HTML and CSS for the frontend and Flask for the backend. The game was made using Python and the highscore table was created using SQLite3. I decided on this project because I wanted to showcase the skills that I picked up during the CS50x course. 

##### The Game:
For the game I used: 
* Python: https://www.python.org/
  * Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
  * Pygbag: https://pypi.org/project/pygbag/0.3.2/

I approached the game first when I started programming as it was the part of the project that was going to be the most complex. After some research I found that I could use the Pygame library to create the game, and the functions within this module were very handy when creating the grid area for the game.

##### The Database
For the database I used:
* SQlite3: https://www.sqlite.org/

In the sqlite database I created a table called scores, which had id, name and score columns. I created three queries for the project.

##### The Website:
For the website I used:
* Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/
* HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
* CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

For the website, I just created a simple outline with HTML to begin with and then I added the CSS styling on top of that.
